# IFT6289 - Final Project

### Stock Price Prediction using LSTM + Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM networks and sentiment analysis of news articles. The project is divided into several parts:
- data collection, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, LSTM model training, and evaluation.
- Dora fine-tuning of Deepseek r1 models
- SLURM scripts (to adapt to your own cluster)
- Helper files for data preprocessing and model training


### Requirements
- Python 3.11.5 or higher

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Agents
Go to the folder `agents` to find the code for the agents. The folder contains the following files:
- Finbert
- deepseek

Two seperate scripts for the models.
