I invest more money in the higher-scoring stocks, and usually hold between **5 and 8 stocks** at a time.\n\n**When I Sell a Stock:**\n\nI sell a stock if:\n\n1. It no longer meets **any one** of the filters above **OR**\n2. A new stock enters that meets all filters and has a higher operating margin, and I already own 8 stocks — in that case, I remove the stock with the weakest operating margin to stay within my 5–8 range.\n\n**Where I'm At:**\n\n* I started the system on **January 3rd**\n* By **February 11th**, I was up **18%**\n* Now it’s **April 2nd**, and I’m **back to breakeven**\n\nIt’s worth noting that about **5% of that 18% gain came from one lucky earnings jump**.

      "Hi, I'm 19 year old from Serbia and I work in cybersecurity field. I make around 1500euro/month which is double the average salary in serbia, but considering the world, it's not significant pay. I am able after all my expenses to put around 300-400$ every month aside and I wanted to learn whats the best way to invest that money for my future. My objectives with this money is generally that I think i started early and have a lot of time (hopefully) so I wanted to invest in time and make life easier for me in the future. My time horizon is not really specific but im looking to invest for some time :) . My risk tolerance is that I don't want blackjack and something that has logic and sense behind its investment. My current holdings are none (except 400$ spare a month :P ) No debts or nothing. Thank you! Let me know if you want any more info from me.",

    "description": "There was a prolonged 12-year-long bull market from 1999 to 2011. Every one of those years generated positive returns too (excluding cost of insurance.) Amid 9/11, Enron/Worldcom fraud, the NASDAQ crash, banking crisis, etc., gold prices climbed from $250 to $1,900 per ounce, with most of those gains squeezed into the last two years (1/1/2010 $1,110/ounce.)\n\n4 years later, in 2015, gold prices had fallen to $1,050 per ounce, a 45% decline.\n\nNow it’s going parabolic again … except there’s no financial crisis, or even an ordinary recession. There’s some instability with the tariffs. There are countries trying to reduce their exposure to US dollars. There are central banks that buy regardless of fundamentals. But these reasons still do not justify a 25% gain in 3 months.\n\nHere’s a chart of gold vs M2 money supply, from 1970 to March 2024:\n\n[https://vaulted.com/wp-content/uploads/M2SL\\_2024-03-01\\_16-54-28\\_45265.png](https://vaulted.com/wp-content/uploads/M2SL_2024-03-01_16-54-28_45265.png)\n\nAs of March 2025 (the latest available data), M2 is $21.7 trillion, not up by much compared to last year.  \n\nThe latest CPI was +2.4% from March 2024 to March 2025.\n\nDuring the same time period, the gold price has increased from $2,000 to almost $3,300 per ounce, a move that rivals 2010-11’s final parabolic surge before the bubble popped.",

      "Wow. I mean, this is tariffs. We’ve heard a lot of philosophical what-ifs but a 5.5B charge FOR THE QUARTER, if I’m seeing this right, is going to be similar to what all international companies face. This is part of a global economy. US consumers can’t make up the world’s pocketbook.\n\nIt was more than a decade ago when I saw the strategy for movie tent-poles (huge, couple a year mega movies) changed. The US was no longer the lions share of film revenue, it was overseas. So movies were opening on the same day world wide. To cut down on piracy and to try and capture as much revenue as possible.\n\nI bring this up because I think this is the case for a lot of international companies. A sign of their success is the fact they aren’t just selling to Nebraska and Virginia. But they’re selling to Belgium and Thailand as well. But they sure as hell aren’t if the prices go through the roof and they have to take charges like this to do business",

    "description": "Reposting because i deleted it when my stop loss sold most of my position and then I sold the rest in panic. didnt want others to get rugged thinking it was still valid, but after reading some break downs of teh 10-k I reiterate the following:\n\nLots of things in its past work against it but many things in its present work for it.\n\n1. SUNE recently acquired a massive 20million dollar in exchange for 17.4m shares of their company. (thats nearly a 55X bullish sentiment in the eyes of the investor at the time of the purchase)\n2. Said funds were used to buy out 12.6 million in secured debt, including 9.6 million which was stated to have an expected lifetime cost of 3,4 million.\n3. They have stated plans to announce the results of their 10-K report, which given recent funding I am very bullish on.\n4. Of those funds they have also stated they have completed their earnout requirements in full. At a cost point of 2,5 million.\n5. Leaving them with a hypothetical 5million. sadly there are expenses and fees for these types of funding, so its likely that they only have from 1-3 million left. However Given their past earning reports thats more than enough to cover their previous expenses, and begin a stock buy back.\n6. Why is a stock buy back important? Apart from them wanting to get maintain a majority holding and fully benefit from their work. There is a massive naked short position on about 1/3rd of the company stock. Meaning that if they can facilitate a short squeeze, it would cause a massive price rise.\n7. IT also has the added benefit of being a fast riser. its showing up in the rising screeners of most brokerage apps, and in this economy may bring it even more volumn to pump the stock up.\n\nThis is a risky but potentially life changing opportunity for some people. That being said, I am not a financial whiz, just bullish as hell and excited for the chance to touch the stars. Please do not buy this stock because i am bullish because ive been trading for like a week. My risk appetite is high, and im young, healthy and have a good job. Please do not take this as financial advise for I am not an advisor and this is not advice. These are merely true statements about SUNE that I interlaced with my own beliefs about the stock.",

      "Ok, since there are no stupid questions here....\n\nAt 3:50pm - exactly ten minutes before the market closes - I very, very often see bid/ask spreads suddenly go wild. The bid goes way down and the ask goes way up and the spread widens - often it doubles. It's almost like the market makers are saying, \"you waited until the end of the trading session, we've got you over a barrel now\". \n\nThis sometimes is even more pronounced on option expiration day.\n\nAm I hallucinating this - or have others seen it too? If it's real, what is the actual cause, and why at that time?",
      "I'm holding $spy 4/30 575 strike price calls - I was up about 7 K on Friday. With SPY going up today by almost 1.34% and VIX is down 15%, I was hoping that my calls would have gone up nicely but instead it went down by 4 K. I'm confused - can you please help me understand ?",
      "This might not be the place to ask, but I'm new into investing and just want to have some fun and maybe lose some money (anything that goes in I'm willing to lose, so it's like a casino for me)\n\nI thought I was getting a grasp on what options were, basically call=you think it's gonna go up, puts=it's gonna go down you pay a fee and buy and then sell the contract if it does what its supposed to\n\nI'm using FIdelty atm and I got confused watching a tutorial\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/331f4ea4d2f13503b24471b393227f43\n\nIn this picture I understand the strike as the number you're buying the contract at, but don't really understand anything else. In this scenario he's buying a strike price (what I wanted to buy the call or put at either lower or higher) he's dating it, with the further you go out the more expensive.\n\nWhere I get lost is at the bid, midpoint, and ask, and also the sell to open side of things. Is the bottom line him setting up to sell if the stock he's buying hits a certain amount?\n\nI understand there's risk but I'm only paying with $20-100 just as a bit of fun",

      "I've been watching the pricing of a specific SPY credit spread (say, long at -.3 short at -.36) as the market slowly climbs in order to learn what happens with its P&L. It seems as though at expiry, the max profit has gone from the underlying at -3% to now -1%.\n\nIs this because puts were so expensive because IV was relatively higher a week ago? Is there any way to predict where this spread's max profit would be at a given IV say back to the mean?"

      "I guess that‘s a sure way to close a short stock position with profiting from additional premium. Similar to closing a long stock position with selling a far ITM call.",
      "1) You sell the 440 put with TSLA at 255 = 185\n\n2) You short 100 shares of TSLA at 255 = 255\n\nTotal Premium received: 185 + 255 = $44000 (obviously)\n\nCurrent interest rates: 3.83%\n\nPer Diem on $44,000 = 44000 \\* .0383 / 360 = $4.681 per day\n\n\\*If\\* they don't get exercised (in a holiday week), you get $4.681 \\* 5 days or +$23.40\n\nThis is a synthetic covered 440 call at $0.23. \n\nIt only works if you have someone who doesn't exercise on the other end. Someone in a spread, or retail trade. I don't see any OI in the 440s, but there is some in the 400s and 460s.",
      "What do u guys use to see what ppl are buying/selling?",
      "It most certainly is related to monthly OpEx. You often see sweep activity like this headed into OpEx. What you aren’t seeing is the other side of the trade. There are lots of plausible reasons why they might do this:\n\n1. Position Adjustment / Synthetic Stock Exit\n\t•\tIf the trader is short stock and wants to exit synthetically, selling a deep ITM put is equivalent to going long stock (due to put-call parity).\n\n\n2. Tax Management (Wash Sale Avoidance or Gains Harvesting)\n\t•\tIf someone is long stock with a gain or loss and wants to reset the cost basis without triggering a wash sale, they might sell a deep ITM put to take delivery after expiration.\n\n3. Roll Trade from Prior Position\n\t•\tThey could be rolling out a deep ITM put from a previous cycle to avoid early assignment or to shift timing.\n\n\n4. Dividend Capture via Put Assignment\n\t•\tIf the stock just went ex-dividend, the person may be trying to get long the stock at a lower net basis through put assignment rather than buying on the open market.\n\n5. Arbitrage / Box Spread Mechanics\n\t•\tThis may be part of a box spread or synthetic interest rate trade:\n\t•\tFor example, they sell a deep ITM put and buy a deep ITM call to replicate a risk-free loan structure.\n\n6. Market Maker or Dealer Hedging\n\t•\tA market maker may be selling deep ITM puts as part of a delta-neutral or volatility trade, especially during expiration week.",

      "I've been reading Naked, Short, and Greedy. It seems to be well researched by Dr. Susan Trimbath, and yet at the same time makes allegations that seem to indicate serious problems with the normal markets for equities and bonds. The main focus is in failure to deliver, which the author asserts happens deliberately in some cases. It also features in so called naked shorting, but can have other issues. She asserts that it creates \"phantom\" shares, since it allows market makers to create shares out of thin air diluting stock values and voting rights.\n\nThere was apparently some attempts to address the issue with Regulation SHO, but she is unconvinced that this is enough to address the issue.\n\nAre FTDs are large issue, or is this taking a smaller issue and making a larger deal out of it that it really is? I can't seem to find the counter argument to her assertions.",

      "I haven’t read her, but was involved in short selling back in the oughts. I think FTD is not that big of an issue. I’ve been closed out on stocks that went to zero because my broker accepted my short sale without first locating shares. So I’ve contributed to the FTD issue, and it was resolved by settlement date. They always are. \n\nThe stats have been up on the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data) since 2004. Patrick Byrne was complaining about the delay in revelation allowing malfeasance back before 2009. You can see there definitely are some stocks that stay FtD issues, but they cannot last longer than a few months. If a broker is allowing long-term, unlocated shorting, they’re gonna get in big trouble with regulators and the exchanges,",

TSMC has a technical monopoly on the most advanced chips in the world. TSMC has pricing power, and the demand for those chips will explode, driven by the increased demand for AI, cloud services and EV adoption. \n\nI value the shares at $338, more than double the current price. The opportunity exists because the market is discounting the stock price to account for the China and tariffs risks. The market thinks China taking over Taiwan is a real risk. I believe that the risk is overblown as the US won’t allow China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nI have written a full thesis (over 7,400 words) backing up each of the claims above, check it out [here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/tsmc-stock-why-this-semiconductor)).

    "description": "Hi all,\n\nIn light of an exceeding amount of rulebreaking posts, the r/economics modteam wanted to both clarify the rules and provide some clear examples of rule breaking. As part of this post, please find links to the [Rule II Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/7x14px/meta_rules_roundtable_2_submissions_and_rii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [Rule III Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where the r/economics mods do an in depth explanation of the purpose and moderation strategy of each of the rules. As these roundtables are quite old, we are open to hearing feedback as well as updating/rehashing these roundtables if the community would like. However, comments on this post that clearly indicate that they have not read the rules roundtables will be removed as they are critical for any productive discussion regarding the subreddit rules.\n\n##Rule II: Economics Relevance\n\nAs stated, rule II is designed to ensure that posts are focused on the *discipline* of economics. This is different to just \"the economy\" as well as business in general. As such, the modteam will continue to remove any articles about stock markets, specific stocks, or specific firms. Posts doing in-depth analysis of an industry as a whole will be allowed. This rule also encompasses the authors/quotegivers/interviewees of particular posts; they must be economists or quote economists. This means that posts about prolific traders or businessmen (such as Jamie Dimon or Warren Buffet) or politicians (such as Donald Trump or Kamala Harris), while plenty interesting, are not welcome in this sub. We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as r/business, r/investing, r/politics, and subreddits for other related topics. \n\nAlongside this, another common rule-breaking post archetype we have been receiving is economics policy *proposals* from candidates, blogsters, and/or organizations. After some discussion, going forward, policy proposals will be removed under Rule II. However, we will continue to allow in-depth analysis of policy proposals as well as announcements regarding the *implementation* of specific policies. For example: articles about \"Politician A would like this policy to happen\" will be removed, but \"These are the effects of this policy\" posts that utilize economics methods or analysis will be allowed. This is quite a nuanced topic as we will also allow policy proposals from ***practicing*** academic economists. These are people who are currently still *producing* high-quality research. This distinction allows the modteam to differentiate from economists-turned-politicians as it would be incredibly difficult for us to distinguish whether Janet Yellen, for example, is speaking in an academic capacity or as the Secretary of Treasury. This is of course, outlined in our Rule II Roundtable, linked above. \n\n##Rule III: Original Source, No Editorializing Title\n\nWith the proliferation of official media outlet accounts we wanted to remind users of our 90-10 guideline for submissions (posts and comments included) that was outlined in our Rule III Roundtable. We have gone ahead and banned a variety of official media outlet accounts for violating this guideline. Please report and send a modmail for any users who also seem to be violating this guideline. We also have finally been given the content moderation option to remove text posts underneath link posts. Users were using this to get around the Rule III guidelines and editorializing under links that they were posting rather than engaging in discussion in the comments. Content rules have been updated to not allow this. \n\nLastly we wanted to encourage users to please refresh their memory on Rules IV and VI (which also has a [rules roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=Economics&utm_content=t5_2qh1s) that was recently updated!) We encourage users to have spirited discussions as long as they follow the rules of the community.",

      "Happy to read this regarding the political posting. I’m as addicted to politics right now as any American is with the election coming up, but when I check in on this sub-Reddit I really just want to read real Econ investigative work and discussion, not political posts ",
      ">We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as r/business, r/investing, r/politics, and subreddits for other related topics.\n\nIf we're being real, the only appropriate subreddit for the overwhelming majority of those rule breaking posts is /r/politics.  \n\nI think you're battling reddit engagement and cross pollination algorithms, you know how reddit is like \"oh, you enjoy posting on highly sensationalized subs like /r/politics, /r/economy, and /r/antiwork? here' also post on /r/economics\"\n\nSo there's a flood of people who just don't understand that some of these subs, /r/economics, /r/finance, /r/investing, etc used to be pretty technical and subject matter oriented, and not just another place to drop that motherjones \"the candidate you hate is bad for the money, here's why\" hitpiece.  It's been 2-3 usernames ago now, but I still remember when this sub was 75% posts from trade journals.    \n\nI do applaud the constant efforts to push this out, but if I can make an observation I think you guys probably need to expand the mod team a bit - I often get the impression that this place goes unmoderated for hours and hours during peak traffic times, so once rules are clamped down on there's a lot of carpet bombing that's happening with the delete button.  Having a few more likeminded people on board that can provide more coverage over time would probably help a ton.  \n\nThe other problem, and IDK how to solve this, is that because of both various economic events driving more people towards these subs, and reddit's engagement algorithms putting more and more absolute noobs in the discussions here a lot of the smart people that used to frequent these places left.  So now conversations can look a lot more like graveyards because the only ones left commenting are the poor saps that found themselves here after browsing a place that has no intellectual barrier to discussion like /r/economy.",
      "I'm glad that something is finally be done regarding this several years long issue.\n\nIt's incredibly sad that this place has rarely, if ever, been a place to discuss actual economics and related policy proposals. It's just been politics 2.0 for so long.\n\nI'm hoping that this makes a permanent change to this place, to make it a place actually meant for learning and discussion, not just talks about how oh so bad Trump is, or how good Kamala is, or how Socialism or Capitalism bad, or yada yada yada.",
      "I fully support both these clarifications to the rules, and hope they it will contribute to more nuance and an elevated level of discussion.\n\nI do think it’s funny though that first post I see immediately following this one is liteterally “Politician A would like this to happen.”",
      "I think it's a bit silly when pure political posts are often allowed here, and yet actual economic policy proposals from a candidate wouldn't be allowed?  I haven't come here as often because I'm tired of seeing actual economic and policy discussion locked, while pure political claptrap is allowed to stay."

      "It’s wild that this doesn’t get more press.\n\nIt’s VERY clear that the president does NOT have the power to enact tariffs.  It’s written directly that ONLY congress is allowed to do that.\n\nEmergency powers allow SOME ability to make trade rules, but absolutely not to this degree against so many countries.  This is more meant for “we are at war with Russia and need to change rules just for them.”  \n\nBut the media and congress decided that the law doesn’t matter here and just happily go along with it.\n\nAt least California is trying.  They should be applauded.",
      "Even IF California wins Trump is unlikely to respect the court’s decision.  Seriously, does California think they can take control of the ports and kick the feds out?   And tariffs are federal jurisdiction.  Only way to win would be to get the courts to admit that tariffs have to be rubber stamped by Congress, and even then Trump will just gaslight everyone again claiming he win the court battle.",
      "Probably won't win.  But just dragging someone through discovery can always be an interesting process.\n\nCould also help Newsom if he's planning to run in 2028 ... which I think he is (I think a Newsom/Walz ticket would be compelling - sadly we mostly need to elect white dudes, but you've got the more liberal/business person and the more rural/hunter person on a ticket like that).",
      "And here I was thinking California was tied up trying to pass the \"Luigi Mangioni act\", a real proposal to prohibit health insurers from denying insurance claims, named to honor the murderer of the United Healthcare CEO....\n\nConstitutionally tarrif power is with Congrress. However, Congress has long enacted laws authorizing the President to adjust tariff rates on goods, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962; Sections 122, 201, and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930; and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. \n\nCourts have generally upheld these laws against constitutional challanges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has traditionally given deference to the President in these cases, allowing the President to utilize these statutes unless he \"clearly misconstrues\" their scope and holding that they commit certain matters to the President's unreviewable discretion."

      "I'm happy I cancelled my Netflix subscription.",
      ">Netflix plans to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported this week, citing anonymous people who attended an “annual business review meeting” that Netflix held in March. Netflix's current market capitalization is nearly $400 billion.\n\n>Netflix is reportedly partnering its market cap goals with plans to double revenue within the same time frame. For 2024, Netflix reported $39 billion in revenue, meaning the company aims to raise its annual revenue to $78 billion in five years.\n\n>Compared to the prior five years, Netflix’s revenue grew 93.5 percent from 2019 ($20.16 billion) to 2024. However, that time period represented a different market, one where streaming subscriber counts were rising rapidly, and Netflix faced less competition than it does today. However, Netflix's 2030 revenue goals are also dependent on its advertising business, something Netflix lacked in 2019.\n\n>WSJ, citing anonymous people who attended Netflix’s March meeting, reported that Netflix plans to make $9 billion in ad sales by 2030. Netflix hasn’t disclosed ad revenue since launching its ad subscription tier in November 2022. However, eMarketer has estimated that Netflix will make over $2 billion in US ad revenue this year.\n\n>Netflix will try growing its ad business by getting more people to subscribe to its ad tier, which is its cheapest subscription option. But additional methods for growing ad revenue will also be critical over the next five years, including showing more live events. Live events force all viewers, including those with ad-free subscriptions, to watch commercials.\n\n>Netflix will also look to take more control over ad revenue tied to its platform by using proprietary ad technology. Since launching its ad tier, Netflix has largely relied on Microsoft for ad tech. Netflix is supposed to release its own technology, a supply-side platform and ad server called The Netflix Ads Suite, this month. The company has discussed potentially introducing new ad formats, like pause ads, while keeping ad loads at four minutes per hour with its tech. However, US President Donald Trump's wavering tariff plans have stirred uncertainty for advertisers and are expected to hurt the ad market in the coming months and years.\n\n>Netflix doesn’t plan to disclose subscriber counts anymore, but one of WSJ’s anonymous sources said that the streaming leader wants to have 410 million subscribers by 2030. That would require Netflix to add 108.4 million more subscribers than it reported at the end of 2024, or about 21.7 million per year, and expand its global reach. In 2024, Netflix added 41.36 million subscribers, including a record number of new subscribers in Q4 2024.\n\n>Netflix plans to release its Q1 2025 earnings report on April 17.\n\n>Should Netflix achieve its reported goals, it would be the first to join the $1 trillion club solely through streaming-related business. The club is currently populated mostly by tech brands, including two companies that own Netflix rivals: Apple and Amazon.\n\n>Netflix is, by far, the most likely streaming candidate to potentially enter the lucrative club. It’s currently beating all other video-streaming providers, including Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, in terms of revenue and profits. Some streaming businesses, including Apple TV+ and Peacock, still aren’t profitable yet.\n\n>Netflix's reported striving for a $1 trillion market cap exemplifies the meteoric rise of streaming since Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007. As linear TV keeps shrinking, and streaming companies continue learning how to mimic the ads, live TV, and content strategies of their predecessors, the door is open for streaming firms to evolve into some of the world's most highly valued media entities.\n\n>The potential for Netflix to have a trillion-dollar market cap also has notable implications for rivals Apple and Amazon, which both earned membership into the $1 trillion club without their streaming services.\n\n>Whether Netflix will reach the goals reported by WSJ is not guaranteed, but it will be interesting to watch how Netflix's strategy for reaching that lofty goal affects subscribers. Further, with streaming set to be more central to the viewing of TV shows, movies, and live events by 2030, efforts around things like ads, pricing, and content libraries could impact media consumption as we head toward 2030.",

    "description": "Hello , \n\nReading through posts here, a common theme is just the sheer lack of hours in the day when you're building something on your own. It feels like you finally carve out time for deep work, only to get pulled into admin, customer service, or trying to research something critical.\n\nI'm really curious – if you could magically delegate 1-3 specific, recurring tasks that aren't your core expertise or product building, what would they be?\n\nFor me, when I was starting my last project, things that always seemed to eat way more time than expected were:\n\n- Deeply validating a new feature idea (beyond just asking friends).\n\n- Handling the constant flow of non-urgent customer emails properly.\n\n- Keeping track of all the little operational things (scheduling follow-ups, basic documentation).\n\nWhat are yours? Is it marketing content? Financial tracking? Lead generation research?\n\nJust trying to get a better sense of the common bottlenecks we all face when flying solo. Interested to hear what everyone struggles with most!",

      "I resisted hiring anybody for the longest time, but eventually reached a point where I had to stop doing everything myself.  My employee's first job was to pack our shipments, because that was a huge timesink for me that I felt was relatively easy to delegate.  Over time the responsibility has grown to a bunch of other things that I am perfectly capable of doing, but my expertise isn't needed for.  Shipping, ordering supplies, weekly maintenance work, etc.\n\nOn the opposite side, there are things that I doubt I'll ever let someone else do.  Either because they're sensitive, or because it's the part of my business that I enjoy which led me to start doing this in the first place.\n\nOver the last few years I've gone from no staff to having one employee, up to four employees, and back down to one.  Finding the balance has been a challenge and I'm by no means straightforward.  Right now I've got one employee, likely growing back up to 2 later this year.  I'm carefully tracking my time at a task level right now to understand what's taking me how long so that I can know what I need to look for when I start looking for someone in June.",

      "Yeah, nothing will come from this. \n\nThese companies pay a lot of smart people a lot of money to run their businesses and pay their taxes in a way where they don't have to pay as much. And do so in the most legal way they can.",
      "Obvious",
      "There is a big difference between '**Avoiding**' (legal) and '**Evading**' (illegal).\n\nI avoid taxes all the time. There are dozens of gas stations just across the border from my state where everyone fills up because the taxes there are way less. This is a form of tax avoidance.",
      "Wow that’s a quarter of the military’s annual budget. Seems like our problems are way beyond taxation of the wealthy",
      "be careful as the word 'avoidance' doesnt suggest anything illegal. it just suggests our tax code needs to be tightened up.\n\nthe article doesnt suggest anything illegal, just that perhaps the richest companies in the world dont need some tax breaks they get that a lot of smaller companies cant."
