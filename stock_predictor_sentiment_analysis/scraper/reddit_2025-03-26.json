But his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future.\n\nTrump has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one.” His plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on U.S. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes.\n\nBut Trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming April 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared.\n\nTrump said Friday that “there’ll be flexibility” on those tariffs, and on Tuesday night suggested the duties will be more “lenient than reciprocal.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the U.S. to avoid facing new tariffs on April 2.",

    "title": "Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs",
    "description": "Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs.\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one” for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.\n\nMovements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla’s stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday’s selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.\n\nThe trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.\n\nFollowing the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month “might not be indicative of true demand.”\n\nNew car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, “could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,” or a “new affordable model,” which they expect in the second half of the year.\n\nTesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.\n\nSome prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk’s political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he’s leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, “pushback from Musk’s foray into politics” has led to “brand damage and even vandalism,” for Tesla at a time when the company’s supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and “Chinese competition continues to heat up.”\n\nStill, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla’s stock, pointing to growth in the company’s energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.\n\nAlphabet’s Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.\n\nIn China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system “Intelligent Assisted Driving,” according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as “Full Self-driving Capability.” Tesla’s system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/tesla-drops-on-slowing-european-sales-concerns-about-trump-tariffs.html",

I have always been interesting in the stock market but just don’t even know where to begin? Like how do you even know or estimate what stock you should invest it? Is it a guessing game? I know this sounds very stupid but it’s because I literally don’t know anything but would really like too! Anyone kind enough to explain it to me/advise me?",

    "description": "My mom has been a hairdresser for over 30 years and recently confided in me that she has almost nothing saved for retirement. She's always prioritized helping me and my sister with college and other expenses over saving for herself. She owns her salon chair but has no 401k, no IRA, and just a small emergency fund.\n\nI'm really worried about her future. She mentioned she plans to \"work until she can't anymore\" but I don't think that's realistic or fair to her. She's already starting to have back problems from standing all day.\n\nI'm 26 with a stable job and have been contributing to my own retirement, but I'm not in a position to fully support her yet. Should I help her open an IRA? Would it even make sense for her to invest aggressively at this age? Is there any way to catch up when starting this late?\n\nWhat government programs might she qualify for? She's divorced and my dad isn't in the picture financially.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the responses! To clarify, she makes around $45-50k annually depending on tips and client volume. She rents her home and has about $5k in credit card debt but no other major debts. Her health is generally good aside from the occupational strain.\n\nEdit 2: Several people have mentioned Social Security. She's been paying into it throughout her career, but I don't think she's looked into what her benefits might be. I'll help her create an account on the SSA website to check.\n\nEdit 3: I really appreciate all the advice (both practical and tough love). I've talked with my sister and we're going to sit down with mom this weekend to create a realistic plan. We've agreed to help supplement her retirement when the time comes, but want to maximize what she can do now.",

      "It's never too late to start putting something aside, but with a short window to retirement I don't even know how much a tax-advantaged account like an IRA would matter. Just start stashing money in a high yield savings account in preparation of needing money to live on.\n\nIf she's been a hairdresser for most of her career, I'd check on the status of her social security at ssa.gov. I know a lot of self-employed people in cash businesses don't do a great job of paying into their social security like they should, and she may not even have that to fall back on.",
      "Open an IRA or self employed 401k for your mom if she owns her own business. Even at 58, if she starts now and saves for 10 years until 68, she can save a decent amount which is much better than nothing.",
      "Bro, the real talk is that she was never going to be able to retire. \n\nRespectfully, she’s a hairdresser with two kids, there’s no saving your way out of that. My mom was a waitress through her mid 50’s until her body gave out and she spent the last 10 years of her life in and out of the hospital (I’m saying this to empathize with your situation, not to dunk or turn it into some weirdo contest). She did the best she could with what she had, but the reality is that she will work until the end of her days even if you can help support her. The absolute best thing you can do for her right now is to find her a job where she doesn’t have to be on her feet all day where maybe she can do hairdressing on the side for extra money."

    "title": "Basic Mining Stock Analysis Guide for Beginners",
    "description": "I posted a general stock analysis guide here a little while ago and was surprised by how well it did. So I figured I’d follow it up with something a bit more specific. This one’s focused on how I personally look at penny stocks, especially junior miners.\n\nJust my take, but I think there’s going to be a lot of opportunity in the junior mining space over the next few years. That said, **it’s also full of junk**. So this post is meant to help people get a basic feel for how to filter through that junk using Sedar filings (or EDGAR in the US).\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to spot the red flags, you just need to know where to look.\n\nAlso please feel free comment any tips of your own, cheers!  \n\n\n**Start with the cash**\n\nMost of these juniors don’t generate any revenue. They’re pre-revenue exploration companies, so they rely entirely on raising capital to stay alive. That means cash is the lifeblood. If they don’t have enough, they’re basically dead in the water until they can raise more.\n\nOpen the latest interim financials and look at “Cash and Cash Equivalents.” That’s the raw cash. Then look at “Working Capital,” which is cash minus short-term liabilities. That gives you a more realistic sense of what they actually have to work with.\n\n**Then figure out how fast they’re burning through it**\n\nScroll to the income statement and find two key items: G&A (general and administrative costs, which include salaries, rent, travel, etc.) and exploration expenses (actual money spent on the project).\n\nAdd those up to get the quarterly burn rate.\n\nDivide by three to estimate their monthly spend. For example, if they spent $600K last quarter and only have $300K left, they’ve got about six weeks of runway. That likely means a financing is coming. And if you’re buying in now, there’s a decent chance you’re stepping in right before dilution.\n\n**Check who’s getting paid**\n\nGo into the MD&A or the notes in the financials and look for “Related Party Transactions.”\n\nThis section tells you if insiders are paying themselves big salaries, or if the company is funneling money to other businesses controlled by management. It’ll also show things like consulting fees to board members or “strategic advisors.”\n\nThis part is important because some companies burn through a ton of cash but don’t do any real work. If the money is all going to people and not into the ground, that’s a red flag.\n\n**Look at the share structure**\n\nCheck how many shares are currently outstanding. Then look at how many are tied up in warrants and stock options. Add it all together to get the fully diluted share count.\n\nIf the company has 50 million shares out, but 150 million fully diluted, that’s a massive potential overhang. It tells you that even if the stock moves up a bit, there could be a lot of selling pressure from those warrants.\n\nAlso pay attention to the pricing. If there are a bunch of $0.05 warrants and the stock is at $0.06, you’re probably going to see people exercising and selling.\n\n**Dig into their past financings**\n\nThis one’s easy to miss but really important. Go through Sedar filings or even just their old news releases and look at when they last raised money.\n\nCheck what price the financing was done at, whether it came with a full warrant, and when that paper becomes free trading. Usually there’s a four-month hold.\n\nOnce that hold expires, it’s common to see selling pressure. People who got in cheap are locking in gains and taking liquidity off the table. If you’re buying right before a wave of cheap paper unlocks, you might just be someone else’s exit.\n\n**Flow-through money is another thing to flag**\n\nThis mostly applies to Canadian companies. Juniors can raise what’s called flow-through capital, which lets them pass tax deductions to investors in exchange for spending the funds on eligible exploration in Canada.\n\nThe catch is that flow-through funds can only be used for that purpose. They can’t be used for general admin or salaries. And they usually need to be spent within 12 to 24 months, depending on the type of raise.\n\nIf the company doesn’t spend it in time, they break the tax deal with investors. That doesn’t mean the money disappears, but it can lead to penalties, or they might have to raise more flow-through just to meet the spending obligation. Either way, it can mean more dilution.\n\nAlso, if they’re sitting on a pile of flow-through and haven’t done any real exploration work, that’s worth paying attention to.\n\n**Read the MD&A**\n\nThis is the most overlooked part of the filings, but probably the most useful.\n\nThe MD&A (Management Discussion and Analysis) is where the company explains what’s going on in plain language. This is where you’ll find clues about whether they’re behind on timelines, struggling to raise money, or quietly shifting plans.\n\nSome specific things to look for:\n\n* “Going concern” warnings\n* Missed or delayed drill programs\n* Quiet changes in exploration strategy\n* Any mention of issues with raising capital\n\nAlso compare what they said they’d do with what they actually did. If they raised $2M “for drilling” and most of it went to salaries, office rent, and consultants, that’s not a great sign.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThis isn’t a deep-dive method or technical breakdown. It’s just a basic scrub you can do in 15 to 20 minutes to avoid walking into obvious traps. Most of the junk companies give themselves away if you actually read their filings.\n\nIf you’re serious about investing in penny stocks (especially junior miners) this stuff becomes second nature. \n\n**Hope this helps someone dodge a bag!**",

      "I am currently reading “Options as a Strategic Investment” by Lawrence G. McMillan. On time value premium decay, he writes “The rate of decay is actually related to the square root of the time remaining. Thus, a 3-month option decays (loses time value premium) at twice the rate of a 9-month option, since the square root of 9 equals 3. Similarly, a 2-month option expires twice as quickly as a 4-month option (sqrt(4)=2)”.   \nThe dependence of the time value on the remaining time can be described as f(t)=sqrt(t), so if you want to know the rate of expiration, you can derive f(t) and get 1/(2\\*sqrt(t)). If I now insert t=9 into the derivative I get about 0.17, if I insert 3 I get about 0.29. How does McMillan arrive at his statement?",

    "title": "Another spambot is targeting us, similar to the last one",
    "description": "**March 24, 2025 UPDATE**: Your reporting is working! A recent attempt by the spambot to spam in our sub, \"$420 in One Day || Surprisingly Easy!\", resulted in Reddit admins suspending the account Reddit-wide. While this may mean that the spambot jumps to another account, at least no *other* spambot can use that same abandoned or stolen account.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n==========\n\nAbout 4 months ago, our sub was targeted by a spambot, repeating posts with similar get-rich-quick schemes. A similar spambot, or maybe the same one since the M.O. is almost identical, is targeting us now. **HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP MODS COMBAT THIS SPAMBOT**.\n\nThe titles of the posts are often very similar and with similar phrasing (I won't give examples here -- if you know, you know). **However, a new twist is that the spambot DELETES the post** after a few hours, before mods can react to your reports. This deprives the mod team of sample posts that we could use to build filters to intercept these spam posts.\n\nThis is a fairly sophisticated spambot campaign that uses a few techniques that make it difficult to defend against. For example (not exhaustive, again, don't want to tip our hand):\n\n* The user who posts appears to be a stolen account. So banning them doesn't do much, the spambot just switches to a different stolen account.\n\n* The posts may contain a statement that they spoke to a mod before posting who said it was OK to post (sometimes actually mentioning a specific moderator by username). This claim is FALSE; don't fall for it. In fact, explicit mention of permission from mods is a good indicator that the post is from the spambot.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\n===============\n\nKeep doing what you are already doing, **report the post to the mod team.** We can't give better than 24 hour response time, but we do eventually see the reports and can at least ban the stolen account, forcing the spambot to switch.\n\n**NEW:** We need samples of the body text of the post before the bot deletes it. We can see the title, but not the body text after the post is deleted. So if you see a post you suspect of being the spambot, **copy/paste the entire body text of the post** and reply to this post in a comment with that copied text. Don't worry about formatting, that's not important. No need to screenshot the body text, unless the spambot changes to posting screenshots itself. Finally, we only need one copy of each post, so if you see others have already commented with the same post text, there is no need to comment again.\n\n**Do NOT engage with or comment on the post.** That doesn't do anything useful and just lets the spambot know that their post is getting through our filters. \n\nDO report the post to Reddit Admins as spam.

    "title": "Warren Buffett and his Cash Pile",
    "description": "Warren Buffett has net sold stocks for 9 straight quarters!\n\nSince he is such a celebrity in the world of investing we should study this in detail and try to come up with explanations of why that might be happening.\n\nThe one obvious explanation of why he is accumulating cash is of course Warren’s anticipation of a major stock market crash. It is important to note that Buffet cash pile accumulation is unusual among other famous investors. It is also important to note that the last time Warren accumulated a lot of cash was around 2006 which was a bit too early before the 2008 market crash. So if indeed he is preparing for a collapse then he might be too early like the last time it happened.\n\nWe already noted in earlier publications that the current market environment does look scary. Let's remind our reader the main points about it.\n\nAfter tax corporate profits as percent of GDP depend on margins of businesses. The higher margins allow businesses to capture a higher percentage of profits from sales. Interest rates play a high role in this among other factors. The higher interest rates make access to capital more expensive and businesses have higher expenses. For example, compare the 1980s when interest rates were very high and 2010s when interest rates were very low.\n\nThe last two years have had quite high interest rates relative to the 2010s.\n\nBuffett Indicator, which is a major indicator of how expensive stocks are in general, is also at record levels. It is calculated as a ratio of stock capitalization to country GDP. Even though it is record high we can say that the counter-argument is that the current US stock market is international now and comparing globalized corporate valuations to a single country’s GDP is not an appropriate measure for the modern world.\n\nThere can be other explanations for Buffett’s cash pile. First of all Warren Buffett is 94 years old and he already lost his partner Charlie Munger so it is possible he is preparing for a succession plan. In that case people try to avoid any high risk and keep the company healthy and ready for the usually dangerous transition period to a new management. Another explanation we could think of is the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway. It is very difficult to invest in stocks when the company size is such that they can acquire full ownership in 475 companies of SP500… Finally it is possible he is finding better opportunities in private equity.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Warren’s huge cash pile it is important to note that he is just one of many successful investors and there were better performing famous investors in the last few decades. We will soon find out how smart Warren’s move was. Exciting times! \n\nFull article: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/warren-buffett-his-cash-pile-tickernomics-hbq8c",

      "People get real wrapped up about Buffet's cash pile.\n\nHis doctrine is stated to be not to spend cash unless he finds something attractive to buy. He doesn't set out to amass cash, the cash pile is just a negative indicator that he can't find anything worth it. He explicitly states that amassing cash is not something he desires to do and that he could care less about timing the market and macro trends.",
      "He is collecting enough to buy off Google’s cofounders. I believe Warren Buffett intends to make Google the new investment vehicle. We might actually see an AI Warren in our lifetimes.",
      "Read the most recent annual report. There are hints that the cash pile is a hedge against Trump.",
      "It's not that complicated.\n\nBuffet is an investor, not a cash hoarder. When he finds something worth investing in (taking into account his company's unique limitations), he'll buy it.",

    "description": "$1.4 billion mkt cap\n \n$2.6 billion EV\n \n$1.1 billion net debt\n \nLTM PE 8.8\nNTM PE 8.7\n \nROE 8.2%, ROA 4.3%\n \nHornbach is a hardware, home improvement, and do it yourself store in Germany. They have been around for many years and currently have about 170 stores between Germany and outside markets. They get a bit higher margin outside Germany because they have competitors like Hagebau and Toom inside Germany. \n \nPre-COVID, the company traded in the 12-14 PE range but post COVID the multiple has been lower. Historically, they have targeted an EBIT margin of 6%, but margins have been in the 4-5% range in recent years. \n \nTop line growth was steady in the mid single digits even through COVID and they were able to pivot to a “click and collect” model, which is still being used today. This may be able to drive some more efficiencies going forward. They keep opening 2-5 stores per year in other countries in Europe. Top line growth suffered last year in the general economic weakness, recording the first year over year revenue decline in the past 20 years. \n \nThere has been really soft consumer demand in Germany due to the general economic weakness, but I’m thinking Germany’s recent 500 billion euro infrastructure bill should turn this around. In addition, many contractors buy building supplies, lumber, and infrastructure supplies from DIY stores like Hornbach so there may be direct demand generated from the bill. \n \nIt is a KGAA and essentially like a tightly controlled family business, with Albrecht Hornbach being the 6th generation in the hardware store business. So there are potentially some corporate governance concerns. \n \nWhen you compare to a U.S. home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe’s it looks like it’s not run quite as efficiently. Hornbach holds a lot of inventory and has large PPE in its stores, that isn’t quite as efficiently used. \n \nHome Depot has a mid 20s PE, has a 4.8X inventory turnover, 77 days of inventory on hand, and a return on assets of 15%. \n \nLowe’s has a high teens PE, has a 3.2X inventory turnover, 111 days of inventory on hand, and also has an ROA of 15%. \n \nHornbach has an 8.8 PE, a 3.6X inventory turnover, 100 days of inventory on hand, and an ROA of just 4.3%. \n \nI used ROA rather than ROE so I don’t have to account for treasury shares. But you get the picture, it’s just not run quite as efficiently for the amount of assets it has. \n \nSo maybe not the same quality business as a Home Depot, maybe not deserving of a high teens or 20s multiple, but still a high single digit multiple seems too cheap. I’m thinking it will probably revert back to the historical 12-14 range. \n \nIf they can run the store more efficiently, get some gains from “click to collect” and margins can also revert to the historical 6%, you may get an added bump, for anywhere from 40-80% gains. \n \nOn the downside the multiple has been as low as 6X earnings, but I think sentiment on Germany likely bottomed out last year and the economy is turning around now.

      "Last time I checked they had around 2B in net assets, being roughly equivalent to the amount of the real estate they own (they own around 61% of the land on which they operate their stores). A couple of years ago, management stated in its annual accounts that they assume the company possesses hidden reserves on their real estate of roughly 800M. \n\nWith a market cap of 1.4B, you’re basically buying € 1 bills (I know these don’t exist) for € 0,70. Question is how this undervaluation will come to fruition, but surely it’s trading at a steep discount compared to its liquidation value. \n\nAs regards their relatively low RoA, have you taken into consideration that their asset base is relatively high due to them owning a lot of the real estate, as compared to leasing it? This might explain the difference in RoA when comparing Hornbach to LOW or HD, but I’m not sure this is the cause of the difference.",

      "I've been reading Naked, Short, and Greedy. It seems to be well researched by Dr. Susan Trimbath, and yet at the same time makes allegations that seem to indicate serious problems with the normal markets for equities and bonds. The main focus is in failure to deliver, which the author asserts happens deliberately in some cases. It also features in so called naked shorting, but can have other issues. She asserts that it creates \"phantom\" shares, since it allows market makers to create shares out of thin air diluting stock values and voting rights.\n\nThere was apparently some attempts to address the issue with Regulation SHO, but she is unconvinced that this is enough to address the issue.\n\nAre FTDs are large issue, or is this taking a smaller issue and making a larger deal out of it that it really is? I can't seem to find the counter argument to her assertions.",
      "Hi, any primer about infra or construction? thanks!",
      "I haven’t read her, but was involved in short selling back in the oughts. I think FTD is not that big of an issue. I’ve been closed out on stocks that went to zero because my broker accepted my short sale without first locating shares. So I’ve contributed to the FTD issue, and it was resolved by settlement date. They always are. \n\nThe stats have been up on the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data) since 2004. Patrick Byrne was complaining about the delay in revelation allowing malfeasance back before 2009. You can see there definitely are some stocks that stay FtD issues, but they cannot last longer than a few months. If a broker is allowing long-term, unlocated shorting, they’re gonna get in big trouble with regulators and the exchanges,",

    "description": "Hornbach AG - HBH\n\n$1.4 billion mkt cap\n \n$2.6 billion EV\n \n$1.1 billion net debt\n \nLTM PE 8.8\nNTM PE 8.7\n \nROE 8.2%, ROA 4.3%\n \nHornbach is a hardware, home improvement, and do it yourself store in Germany. They have been around for many years and currently have about 170 stores between Germany and outside markets. They get a bit higher margin outside Germany because they have competitors like Hagebau and Toom inside Germany. \n \nPre-COVID, the company traded in the 12-14 PE range but post COVID the multiple has been lower. Historically, they have targeted an EBIT margin of 6%, but margins have been in the 4-5% range in recent years. \n \nTop line growth was steady in the mid single digits even through COVID and they were able to pivot to a “click and collect” model, which is still being used today. This may be able to drive some more efficiencies going forward. They keep opening 2-5 stores per year in other countries in Europe. Top line growth suffered last year in the general economic weakness, recording the first year over year revenue decline in the past 20 years. \n \nThere has been really soft consumer demand in Germany due to the general economic weakness, but I’m thinking Germany’s recent 500 billion euro infrastructure bill should turn this around. In addition, many contractors buy building supplies, lumber, and infrastructure supplies from DIY stores like Hornbach so there may be direct demand generated from the bill. \n \nIt is a KGAA and essentially like a tightly controlled family business, with Albrecht Hornbach being the 6th generation in the hardware store business. So there are potentially some corporate governance concerns. \n \nWhen you compare to a U.S. home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe’s it looks like it’s not run quite as efficiently. Hornbach holds a lot of inventory and has large PPE in its stores, that isn’t quite as efficiently used. \n \nHome Depot has a mid 20s PE, has a 4.8X inventory turnover, 77 days of inventory on hand, and a return on assets of 15%. \n \nLowe’s has a high teens PE, has a 3.2X inventory turnover, 111 days of inventory on hand, and also has an ROA of 15%. \n \nHornbach has an 8.8 PE, a 3.6X inventory turnover, 100 days of inventory on hand, and an ROA of just 4.3%. \n \nI used ROA rather than ROE so I don’t have to account for treasury shares. But you get the picture, it’s just not run quite as efficiently for the amount of assets it has. \n \nSo maybe not the same quality business as a Home Depot, maybe not deserving of a high teens or 20s multiple, but still a high single digit multiple seems too cheap. I’m thinking it will probably revert back to the historical 12-14 range. \n \nIf they can run the store more efficiently, get some gains from “click to collect” and margins can also revert to the historical 6%, you may get an added bump, for anywhere from 40-80% gains. \n \nOn the downside the multiple has been as low as 6X earnings, but I think sentiment on Germany likely bottomed out last year and the economy is turning around now.

      "Eh, debt to EBITDA is 2.3x… Home Depot runs with 2.2X debt to EBITDA and Lowe’s has 2.8x debt to EBITDA… seems pretty consistent with the industry. \n \nInterest was $57 million TTM, EBIT covers it 5.5X. Has been consistently profitable for all 23 years I have data. \n \nInterest rates are pretty low in the Euro area… On $1.2 billion of debt, seems like their effective interest rate is around 4.7%… seems pretty low and probably a lot lower than cost of equity at these prices. \n \nDon’t feel the debt level is excessively high or too concerning at these levels."

    "description": "[**Makings of a Multi-Bagger - Alta Fox Capital**](https://macro.com/app/pdf/64de8eb5-3097-4ae0-8dc4-b9c48ee2c627)\n\n**Core Concepts**\n\n* **Small-Cap Edge:** Market data confirms 84% of outperformers had capitalizations below $2 billion, with optimal opportunities in the $1-10 billion range. Limited analyst coverage creates information asymmetries that patient investors can exploit, or pricing inefficiencies in this market segment. Value investors should thereby systematically screen for these sorts of inefficient market segments, seeking quality businesses overlooked by institutional investors constrained by size or liquidity requirements.\n* **Cash Flow Metrics:** Companies converting over 90% of EBITDA to free cash flow while maintaining reinvestment opportunities with documented returns on incremental capital demonstrate superior investment characteristics. Free cash flow growth provides a quantifiable indicator of business performance with higher correlation to investment returns than accounting earnings across multiple market cycles.\n* **Competitive Position Analysis:** Businesses with a sustainable moat maintain profit margins during industry downturns through measurable pricing power, quantifiable switching costs, or proprietary technologies. These advantages can be confirmed via improved operating performance, such as consistent gross margin maintenance despite competitive pressures or input cost inflation.\n* **Market Position Trends:** Quantitative analysis of market share changes, customer retention rates, and competitive responses indicates whether a company's position is strengthening or weakening over time. Companies demonstrating expanding market share despite competitive responses typically outperform market expectations in subsequent periods.\n* **Capital Allocation Track Record:** Historical analysis of management capital deployment decisions provides predictive insight into future capital efficiency, measured through acquisition returns, buyback timing effectiveness, and reinvestment discipline. The timing of capital deployment relative to market cycles and industry conditions serves as an objective measure of management judgment.\n* **Value Recognition Factors:** Specific corporate events including leadership changes, business restructuring, shareholder activism, and segment reorganizations correlate with compression in the time required for market valuation adjustments. These corporate actions have demonstrable effects on valuation multiples independent of operational performance improvements.\n* **Balance Sheet Parameters:** Companies maintaining debt-to-EBITDA ratios below 2.5×, interest coverage above 5×, and returns on invested capital exceeding 15% exhibit lower default probabilities and greater operational flexibility. These financial parameters correlate with resilience during economic contractions and the ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities when financing costs increase.\n* **Sector Financial Characteristics:** Technology and healthcare companies with gross margins in excess of 65% and documented reinvestment opportunities statistically outperform lower-margin businesses over longer time horizons. The sectors meeting the aforementioned criteria exhibit a higher ROIC and longer growth runways when measured against traditional industrial or consumer businesses.",

    "title": "[Meta] Rules II & III: Policy Proposals and Non-economists",
    "description": "Hi all,\n\nIn light of an exceeding amount of rulebreaking posts, the r/economics modteam wanted to both clarify the rules and provide some clear examples of rule breaking. As part of this post, please find links to the [Rule II Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/7x14px/meta_rules_roundtable_2_submissions_and_rii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [Rule III Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where the r/economics mods do an in depth explanation of the purpose and moderation strategy of each of the rules. As these roundtables are quite old, we are open to hearing feedback as well as updating/rehashing these roundtables if the community would like. However, comments on this post that clearly indicate that they have not read the rules roundtables will be removed as they are critical for any productive discussion regarding the subreddit rules.\n\n##Rule II: Economics Relevance\n\nAs stated, rule II is designed to ensure that posts are focused on the *discipline* of economics. This is different to just \"the economy\" as well as business in general. As such, the modteam will continue to remove any articles about stock markets, specific stocks, or specific firms. Posts doing in-depth analysis of an industry as a whole will be allowed. This rule also encompasses the authors/quotegivers/interviewees of particular posts; they must be economists or quote economists. This means that posts about prolific traders or businessmen (such as Jamie Dimon or Warren Buffet) or politicians (such as Donald Trump or Kamala Harris), while plenty interesting, are not welcome in this sub. We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as r/business, r/investing, r/politics, and subreddits for other related topics. \n\nAlongside this, another common rule-breaking post archetype we have been receiving is economics policy *proposals* from candidates, blogsters, and/or organizations. After some discussion, going forward, policy proposals will be removed under Rule II. However, we will continue to allow in-depth analysis of policy proposals as well as announcements regarding the *implementation* of specific policies. For example: articles about \"Politician A would like this policy to happen\" will be removed, but \"These are the effects of this policy\" posts that utilize economics methods or analysis will be allowed. This is quite a nuanced topic as we will also allow policy proposals from ***practicing*** academic economists. These are people who are currently still *producing* high-quality research. This distinction allows the modteam to differentiate from economists-turned-politicians as it would be incredibly difficult for us to distinguish whether Janet Yellen, for example, is speaking in an academic capacity or as the Secretary of Treasury. This is of course, outlined in our Rule II Roundtable, linked above. \n\n##Rule III: Original Source, No Editorializing Title\n\nWith the proliferation of official media outlet accounts we wanted to remind users of our 90-10 guideline for submissions (posts and comments included) that was outlined in our Rule III Roundtable. We have gone ahead and banned a variety of official media outlet accounts for violating this guideline. Please report and send a modmail for any users who also seem to be violating this guideline. We also have finally been given the content moderation option to remove text posts underneath link posts. Users were using this to get around the Rule III guidelines and editorializing under links that they were posting rather than engaging in discussion in the comments. Content rules have been updated to not allow this. \n\nLastly we wanted to encourage users to please refresh their memory on Rules IV and VI (which also has a [rules roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=Economics&utm_content=t5_2qh1s) that was recently updated!) We encourage users to have spirited discussions as long as they follow the rules of the community.",

      "Happy to read this regarding the political posting. I’m as addicted to politics right now as any American is with the election coming up, but when I check in on this sub-Reddit I really just want to read real Econ investigative work and discussion, not political posts ",
      ">We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as r/business, r/investing, r/politics, and subreddits for other related topics.\n\nIf we're being real, the only appropriate subreddit for the overwhelming majority of those rule breaking posts is /r/politics.  \n\nI think you're battling reddit engagement and cross pollination algorithms, you know how reddit is like \"oh, you enjoy posting on highly sensationalized subs like /r/politics, /r/economy, and /r/antiwork? here' also post on /r/economics\"\n\nSo there's a flood of people who just don't understand that some of these subs, /r/economics, /r/finance, /r/investing, etc used to be pretty technical and subject matter oriented, and not just another place to drop that motherjones \"the candidate you hate is bad for the money, here's why\" hitpiece.  It's been 2-3 usernames ago now, but I still remember when this sub was 75% posts from trade journals.    \n\nI do applaud the constant efforts to push this out, but if I can make an observation I think you guys probably need to expand the mod team a bit - I often get the impression that this place goes unmoderated for hours and hours during peak traffic times, so once rules are clamped down on there's a lot of carpet bombing that's happening with the delete button.  Having a few more likeminded people on board that can provide more coverage over time would probably help a ton.  \n\nThe other problem, and IDK how to solve this, is that because of both various economic events driving more people towards these subs, and reddit's engagement algorithms putting more and more absolute noobs in the discussions here a lot of the smart people that used to frequent these places left.  So now conversations can look a lot more like graveyards because the only ones left commenting are the poor saps that found themselves here after browsing a place that has no intellectual barrier to discussion like /r/economy.",
      "I'm glad that something is finally be done regarding this several years long issue.\n\nIt's incredibly sad that this place has rarely, if ever, been a place to discuss actual economics and related policy proposals. It's just been politics 2.0 for so long.\n\nI'm hoping that this makes a permanent change to this place, to make it a place actually meant for learning and discussion, not just talks about how oh so bad Trump is, or how good Kamala is, or how Socialism or Capitalism bad, or yada yada yada.",
      "I fully support both these clarifications to the rules, and hope they it will contribute to more nuance and an elevated level of discussion.\n\nI do think it’s funny though that first post I see immediately following this one is liteterally “Politician A would like this to happen.”",
      "I think it's a bit silly when pure political posts are often allowed here, and yet actual economic policy proposals from a candidate wouldn't be allowed?  I haven't come here as often because I'm tired of seeing actual economic and policy discussion locked, while pure political claptrap is allowed to stay."

If he exempts items covered by the USMCA, then it will have the biggest impact on European brands that are not as vertically integrated in the US."

      "The debt ceiling is only a major political issue when the republicans control just the house or the senate, they control both right now.  It'll be raised without a single whimper.",
      "Firing employees from the IRS, makes little sense if raising revenue is a priority, the savings from the doge aren't really enough to make a considerable contribution towards fiscal holes, so at the end of the day is about dismantling government with an excuse of unsustainable debt.",
      "> The federal government could hit its borrowing limit as soon as May if tax revenue falls short of expectations, or as late as September if debt stays on its current course, Congress’s nonpartisan bookkeeper reported Wednesday — potentially requiring Republicans to dramatically accelerate their timeline on legislation that would prevent a catastrophic default.\n\n> Lawmakers are attempting to pass a massive package to extend expiring tax cuts and authorize new spending on immigration enforcement and national security — what President Donald Trump has taken to calling his “big, beautiful bill” — before Memorial Day. That legislation is also slated to include a $4 trillion increase to the debt limit, which caps how much the federal government can borrow to pay for spending it has already approved.\n\n> The government technically eclipsed the debt ceiling in January, but the Treasury Department has been taking what are known as “extraordinary measures” to delay certain payments to stretch out the government’s available cash.\n\n> As things stand now, and with big inflows of funds expected around April 15 and June 15 when tax payments are due, the government’s “X date,” or the day when the extraordinary measures won’t be enough to prevent more borrowing, could come in August or September, the Congressional Budget Office reported.\n\n> But that date is heavily dependent on how much the Internal Revenue Service collects this filing season. And already, officials at the tax agency are growing concerned about a sharp drop in revenue collection, which could fall by as much as 10 percent compared to 2024. That would mean a roughly $500 billion shortfall that could substantially hasten the X date by forcing the government to borrow more money in the short term to pay its bills.\n\n> That variability led the CBO to report a relatively wide date range.\n\n> “The projected exhaustion date is uncertain because the timing and amount of revenue collections and outlays over the intervening months could differ from CBO’s projections,” the agency wrote.\n\n> Earlier in the week, the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank estimated the X date between mid-July and early October based on its own calculations.\n\n> The Treasury Department officially sets the date after the April tax deadline.\n\n> Without legislation to raise the debt limit by a dollar amount, or suspend it for a length of time, the government would default on its loans. That could thrust the economy into a deep recession and shake up global markets, experts say.\n\n> Much of the world’s economy relies on U.S. government debt as backstop. If the Treasury Department’s ability to make good on its debt were called into question, that could spook markets and lead employers and financial institutions to quickly pull back investments.",

That includes most of the output of the big German brands, economy, and luxury, almost every exotic vehicle, and a huge chunk of the Asian mass market vehicles from Hyundai, Kia, and Honda, that Americans love to buy. Their simply isn’t enough latent industrial capacity in the United States to build all of those cars domestically. Let alone the fact that it would take hundreds of billions of dollars, years of supply chain readjustment, and take away jobs from allies who would fight tooth and nail to keep them in their own countries (recall the protests when VW considered layoffs at *one* of their German plants*). This is stupendously dumb in so many ways it’s hard to even describe.

      "In a piece for Stanford’s Institute for Economic Policy Research, [Amit Seru](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/amit-seru) lays out the case that the “U.S. banking system is burdened by a convoluted regulatory architecture, where multiple agencies — federal and state — oversee financial institutions with overlapping jurisdictions and, at times, competing interests.” The downside of such a system, Seru suggests, was evident in the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, where regulators also failed to anticipate issues within these institutions. Seru argues that the current federal administration should utilize its opportunity to “to consolidate oversight responsibilities between the regulatory bodies, address inefficiencies between federal and state regulators, and implement tools such as a performance scorecard to assess regulators.”\n\n\"The U.S. banking system remains vital to global finance, but its outdated regulatory architecture threatens its resilience and public trust,\" Seru writes. \"By reducing complexity, fostering accountability, and aligning incentives, we can create a smarter, leaner framework that promotes both stability and innovation, allowing American finance to thrive and lead the way forward.\"",

      "Regulators didn’t fail to identify anything. They noted issues with SVB a couple years before it blew up. The regulators failed to escalate the issues into formal enforcement action, not that they didn’t catch it. Too little too late. \n\nAlso SVB was a state chartered bank, so the federal bank regulators don’t have as much jurisdiction over SVB. California state regulator is a main player, and the FRB/FDIC involvement is dependent on the asset size and condition of the institution, and if they’re a member bank.\n\nAlso, not every bank wants the federal charter. The laws are more stringent, oversight is more rigorous, and the assessment fees are higher. The benefit is preemption, easier to do business in multiple states, and  generally higher quality supervision. Not every bank board wants that. The Fed, FDIC and OCC “regulate” the federal banks at much different levels of rigor. They duplicate some work, but one is more “in the weeds” and the other is generally higher level/less granular. \n\nNot arguing that the current system is the most efficient or the best way of doing things. But it’s much more nuanced than you think, even just on the bank supervision side and ignoring the other functions the FRB and FDIC do. haphazard decisions from the current administration will undoubtedly weaken the US banking system at both the state and federal level."

Furthermore, the increases in tariffs under the Trump administration are anticipated to raise inflation, causing the Fed to reassess its position on interest rates more frequently than previously thought.\n\n* [Fed holds interest rates steady, still sees two cuts coming this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html)\n* [The Fed holds rates firm—here's what it means for your money - CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/federal-reserve-borrowing-costs-wont-drop-much-this-year.html)\n\n^(This is a bot made by [Critique AI](https://critique-labs.ai).

      "I do not think we will see any rate cuts for as long as Trump keeps shorting the stock market."

      "Great article, can't help but think that the money laundering operations featured in this article were caught due to the sheer amateurism and audacity of the participants. I feel like there are large, semi-legetimate operations laundering on a much greater scale, obfuscated by an actual business underneath.",
      "TD Bank's recent allegations reveal that between 2014 and 2023, the bank maintained systemic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering practices, allowing over $670 million to be laundered through its accounts, making it significantly complicit in criminal activities. The actions taken against TD Bank, which included a historic $3.1 billion penalty and a guilty plea for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, underscore its prioritization of profit over compliance, setting a precedent in U.S. banking history.\n\n* [The Criminal Money Laundering Scams That Cost TD Bank Billions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-18/the-criminal-money-laundering-scams-that-cost-td-bank-billions)\n* [TD Bank Pleads Guilty to Bank Secrecy Act and Money Laundering ...](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/td-bank-pleads-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-and-money-laundering-conspiracy-violations-18b)\n\n^(This is a bot made by [Critique AI](https://critique-labs.ai).

      ">Dollar Tree’s decade-long effort to fold the Family Dollar chain into its business is ending, after the Virginia-based discount retailer said it’s selling it to a pair of private equity firms for $1 billion.\n\n>Dollar Tree Inc. bought Family Dollar with its over 7,000 stores ten years ago for more than $8 billion.\n\n>Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said that Dollar Tree struggled with supply chain issues, poor store locations and other operational difficulties ever since making the acquisition.\n\n>“Basically, Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew,” he said.\n\n>Last year Dollar Tree announced that it planned to close hundreds of Family Dollar stores.\n\n>Dollar Tree had been scouting options for Family Dollar for a while and said Wednesday that the sale to Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management will allow it to focus on its core business.\n\n>“This is a major milestone in our multiyear transformation journey to help us fully achieve our potential,” said Mike Creedon, who was made permanent chief executive officer of Dollar Tree late last year.\n\n>During a conference call, Creedon noted how Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are “two different businesses with limited synergies.” The sale will now allow each one to concentrate on its specific needs, he added.\n\n>Bargain chains like Dollar Tree, which have raised some of their prices in recent years, are finding that they have little room to maneuver. Americans have tightened their spending as consumer confidence in the economy slides.\n\n>Family Dollar, which moved its headquarters from North Carolina to Chesapeake, Virginia, after the sale to Dollar Tree, will maintain its headquarters in Virginia.\n\n>The deal is expected to close later in the second quarter.",

      "What’s funny is my kids LOVE Dominoes. We tried going to Papa John’s, Pizza Hut and local joints that IMO serve much better pies, but my kids insist on Dominos \n\nThe good news is that the local brewery by my house is right next to Dominoes and they always host top tier food trucks. So it’s super easy to get the kids an $8 pizza while my wife and I load up on food truck grub, which is usually great but ALWAYS crazy expensive.",
      "i think about the margins of pizza 🍕 a lot and came to the conclusion a while ago that they used to make so much more money selling pizza in the 80s and 90s its insane. Now they have absorbed most of the inflation onto their overhead. Only cheese 🧀 prices dictate the price of pizza in a area.",
      "Domino’s is legitimately cheaper than any of my family’s preferred frozen brands (when not on sale). Absolutely wild.",
      "I’ll never forget the 180 this company did, masterclass.",
      "The most impressive part of Dominos is they’ve managed to get cheaper (inflation adjusted) and better."

Initially just for fun, everything changed when a friend happened to use my laptop and got genuinely interested. He paid me 50 for the tool, and that wasn't the end of it. And then we launched it as a product called leadsnavi, we have hit 50k by the end of last month. I do think just give a try and quit once you thought that is the time.",
      "Start small, work from home after your regular job. Make sure it’s something you LOVE to do and willing to make a dollar an hour. Put everything back into your side business.  I think it was on my 6th year my revenue was shy of half a million.",
      "I'm up to $12k USD/year so far and climbing slowly...",
      "Currently I'm running multiple companies:\n\n1. Liveupx.com ($259k ARR): a software development & marketing Agency - 4 years old, with a very small team.\n2. MentorJi.Live ($60k ATR): an EdTech - 1.5 years old\n3. Pitch-Deck.Agency: Premium creative design. ( 15k) - 7 months old.\n4. Widgetx.site: AI SaaS ($0) - 7 months old.\n5. Gurjar.App: Social Media Platform - $2000, 6 years old (shutting it down)\n\nHere’s a quick overview of my experience :\n\n1. Liveupx.com\n\nYour one-stop solution for all software development (Web, app, ERP, CRM, SaaS, web3, AI web apps) and marketing needs. \n\nI started this in 2020 with just a small team of 2-3 members. My approach was simple: if a client paid me $100, I delivered work worth $500. \n\nThis strategy turned my clients into my best marketers, leading to referrals. \n\nThis year, we're on track to hit over $300k in annual revenue with just 12 team members and without spending a dime on ads! \n\nMy goal is to reach $1M in the next 2 years.\n\nKey Strategies:\n→ Build a strong portfolio, & ask for genuine video testimonials.\n→ Focus on specific niches (mine are VC firms, NGOs, healthcare, and EdTech).\n→ Deliver quality works on time and exceeds expectations.\n→ Target high-ticket clients for better management and earnings.\n→ Ask for feedback from your client (how you can improve your services)\n→ Never hesitate to ask for help/work\n\n2. MentorJi.Live\n\nA platform created by students, for students, offering live batches for IIT-JEE, NEET, CUET, SSC, and UPSC. \n\nI started this in 10th grade, but it faced challenges, no one believed in me and had to shut down. \n\nHowever, with the boom in the EdTech industry during COVID, my former school teachers approached me in 2023 (those who refused to work with me), and we relaunched MentorJi. \n\nThose teachers are now my employees.\n\nWe just launched our first paid batches two months ago and have already achieved $60k in sales without any ad spend. \n\nThis year, 15 of our students are set to enter MBBS programs!\n\nKey Strategies:\n→ Utilize YouTube for marketing.\n→ Provide free content to build trust.\n→ Launch valuable courses.\n→ Provide real value & help students genuinely \n\n\n3. www.Pitch-Deck.Agency \n\nWe deliver premium pitch decks designed to secure real investments. \n\nThis service started as part of Liveupx. While others charge $2000 to $5000 for pitch decks & deliver it within 2-4 weeks, we offer them for $500 to $2500 within a week, leveraging our existing client relationships without additional ad costs.\n\n4. Widgetx.site: AI powered SaaS Platform ($0) - 7 months old.\n\nThis project aims to boost website sales, engagement, and credibility—completely free! It’s still in development, and I’m currently looking for a co-founder. You can read more about it here: https://widgetx.site/faq\n\nIf you have any feedback for me, pls DM me, I’ll highly appreciate it + If you have any work for me, pls let me know.\n\nconnect with me over Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammohitchaprana/\n\n+ for those who think that I belong to a very privileged family, No. My father is a farmer & they haven’t given me any money to start any of my startups!",
